        <h1>R2K:The Concert</h1>
        <p>R2K: The Concert was the first arena <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert">concert</a> by Filipina
            entertainer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regine_Velasquez">Regine Velasquez</a> R, held on April 7
            and 8,
            2000, at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City. It was a part of Velasquez's promotion of her tenth studio
            album, R2K (1999). It was exclusively promoted by Viva Concerts, with beauty brands Pond's and Sunsilk as
            sponsors. Velasquez served as the stage and creative director for the show, which featured Ogie Alcasid,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Eigenmann"> Gabby Eigenmann</a>, Janno Gibbs, Jaya, and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC_Montero">KC Montero </a> as guest acts.

            The concert's production and staging featured a 360-degree configuration with a semi-circular plexiglass
            stage, four large video screens, and an <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_system#Flying_rig">automated flying rig</a> used during
            Velasquez's aerial performance of
            "On the Wings of Love" and "Butterfly". She collaborated on outfits with designer Rajo Laurel, who drew
            inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolce_%26_Gabbana">Dolce & Gabbana</a> 's
            "print-on-print" collection. The set list included songs predominantly
            taken from R2K and various covers of pop hits from 1999 and 2000; these included "Larger than Life" by the
            Backstreet Boys and a medley of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Had_My_Love">"If You Had My
                Love"</a> , "Waiting for Tonight", and "Let's Get Loud" by
            Jennifer Lopez, which she performed as part of the opening set.

            R2K: The Concert received generally positive reviews from <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_journalism"> music critics</a>, who praised Velasquez's
            showmanship
            and vocal abilities, as well as the stage production. Critics also lauded the costumes and her look during
            the concert. For her work, Velasquez was awarded Best Female Major Concert Act at the 13th Aliw Awards. The
            show was broadcast in its entirety on June 21, 2000, on <a

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regine_Velasquez"> Regine Velasquez </a>released her tenth studio
            album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2K">R2K</a> on November 27, 1999.[1] A cover album, it
            contains
            remakes of pop music from the 1970s and 1980s,[2] issued with a bonus Video CD (VCD) of six music videos
            for its tracks, including Bread's <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Without_Your_Love_(song)">"Lost Without Your Love"</a> and
            George Benson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Your_Eyes_(George_Benson_song)">"In Your
                Eyes"</a> . Velasquez
            became the first Filipino artist to release an album with an accompanying VCD. The album was a
            commercial success, selling over 40,000 copies in the second week of release and earning a platinum
            certification from the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Association_of_the_Record_Industry">Philippine
                Association of the Record Industry</a> .[1] As part of the album's
            promotion, Velasquez performed in small venues,[3] which included a three-day event at the Music Museum
            called Regine 2000.[4] In January 2000, Velasquez's publicist Hanzel Villafuerte revealed that she was
            planning a headlining concert in April.[5] The following month, it was announced that Velasquez would
            perform two dates on April 7–8, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araneta_Coliseum">Araneta
                Coliseum</a> .[6] The show's producers, Viva Concerts,
            officially named it R2K: The Concert,[7] and partnered with beauty brands Pond's and Sunsilk as
            sponsors.[8] Velasquez and her team selected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogie_Alcasid">Ogie
                Alcasid,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Eigenmann"> Gabby Eigenmann,</a> Janno
            Gibbs, Jaya, and KC
            Montero as special guests.[8][9]

            Unlike Velasquez's previous concerts—which were staged at the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanghalang_Francisco_Balagtas">Folk Arts Theater,</a> a
            9,000-seat music
            venue—the concert was her first performance in a large-scale indoor arena. Velasquez stated that she was
            excited, yet nervous about the show: "It's my first time to perform at such a big venue. For the longest
            time, my manager wanted me to do it, but I felt I wasn't ready yet."[9] Velasquez was heavily involved
            in planning and production, and revealed that rehearsals and preparations for it made her anxious.[9]
            The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Daily_Inquirer">Philippine Daily Inquirer</a>
            previewed that it would be her "biggest and most expensive concert to
            date", adding that her main objective was to deliver performances that "range from pop, ballads, rock
            and even rap".[10] She asserted, "I do this mainly to entertain ... I'm not out to prove anything. I
            just hope the public enjoys my performance".[9] Velasquez served as stage and creative director, while
            Marc Lopez and Louie Ignacio were chosen as musical and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_director">television directors,</a>
            respectively.[9The show featured a 360-degree configuration with an end-stage setup and four large video
            screens.[9][11][12] The two-tiered stage design included a semi-circular <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly(methyl_methacrylate)">plexiglass </a> main
            platform,[13][14] which connected to the upper stage by twin staircases.[12] The central area of the
            stage was spaced for the musicians and background vocalists.[12] The concert included elements of
            pyrotechnics and aerial suspension.[11] Velasquez had been toying with the idea of doing an aerial
            performance after seeing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Abdul">Paula Abdul'</a> s <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_My_Spell_Tour">Under My Spell Tour</a> (1992) in Manila,
            and took inspiration from
            Abdul being transported by wires during a performance of "Spellbound".[15][16] Velasquez presented the
            concept to her team and had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_system#Flying_rig">automated
                flying rig </a> custom-built to be used for "On the Wings of
            Love".[15]

            Velasquez commissioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_family_(Philippines)">Rajo
                Laurel</a> to create all her costumes during the show.[17] The designer was
            inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolce_%26_Gabbana">Dolce & Gabbana's</a>
            "print-on-print" collection, paying attention to "postmodern outfits" that
            embodied "elegance and high style".[9][17] The opening outfit consisted of a black leather bodysuit with
            a monochromatic opera coat and accompanying knee high boots. For a quick costume change after the
            opening segment, Laurel produced a gold metallic spaghetti-strapped top, incorporating a psychedelic
            micro-mini skirt over animal print tights.[18] Another piece worn by Velasquez during her aerial number
            was a yellow gown embellished with butterfly appliqués, which was accentuated with long skirt
            panels,[18][19][14] and a black backless long gown patterned with sheer fabrics that bared the singer's
            midriff, upper thighs, and legs.</p>

            alt="image">
        <p>Considered the highlight of the show, Velasquez's aerial performance received positive critical reception.
        </p>
        <p>The concert opened with a video montage showing images of Velasquez and footage from her music videos, films,
            and past live performances. As two female dancers lifted by wires performed aerial acrobatics, Velasquez
            sang excerpts from the chorus of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys">Backstreet
                Boys's</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larger_than_Life_(song)"> "Larger than Life"</a>
            (1999), before disappearing
            offstage.[12] She reappeared on the upper stage and continued the song while dancing.[12][19] After a
            costume change, Velasquez began a medley of Jennifer Lopez's "If You Had My Love", <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Tonight">"Waiting for Tonight"</a> ,
            and "Let's Get Loud". She then sat centerstage for a performance of the Carpenters' "One Love" (1971),
            transitioning directly into Dionne Warwick's "I'll Never Love This Way Again" (1979). The next segment
            opened with Velasquez performing ABBA's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Queen">"Dancing
                Queen" </a> (1976), which was mashed with Orleans's "Dance With
            Me" (1974). It was followed with a performance of "I Believe" (1953) and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prayer_(Celine_Dion_and_Andrea_Bocelli_song)">The Prayer</a>
            (1999) alongside Ogie
            Alcasid and Janno Gibbs.[12]

            During the performance of "On the Wings of Love" (1982), Velasquez was lifted by wires, revealing long skirt
            panels adorned with butterfly appliqués that billowed out around her as if she was flying towards the
            audience.[12] At the end of the performance, she sat down and spoke to the crowd about falling out of love,
            before performing Marvin Hamlisch's "Fallin" (1978). She closed the segment with Mariah Carey's "Butterfly"
            (1997), during which she was taken back to the upper stage by wires.[12][14][19]

            The setlist continued with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isley_Brothers">the Isley
                Brothers'</a> "For the Love of You" (1975), where Velasquez was joined by
            Eigenmann and Montero. The duo added a rap routine to the number.[12][19] She then sang a duet of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habang_May_Buhay_(album)">"Habang
                May Buhay"</a> (1994) with Jaya, which was followed by a debut performance of "Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw", the
            main
            theme song of Velasquez's film of the same name.[12] After confessing how she enjoyed recording love themes
            for films, Velasquez stated, "I never realized that one day, I would be able to sing the theme songs of my
            own movies", before she sang a medley of her film soundtracks. She then sat by the staircase for an acoustic
            performance of "Sana Maulit Mulit", before continuing with Celine Dion's "That's the Way It Is" (1999).[12]

            For the final act, Velasquez sang a ballad version of Aerosmith's <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don%27t_Want_to_Miss_a_Thing">"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"</a>
            (1998) with
            a brief pyrotechnics display at the conclusion of the number.[12] After the song ended, she thanked the
            audience before exiting the stage. She performed "Written in the Sand" for the encore, which she had
            introduced as a song she interpreted during the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_celebration"> millennium television special 2000
                Today.</a>[20] She closed the
            show with a medley of 1980s music: "Fame", "Flashdance... What a Feeling",<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_Me_Up_Buttercup">"Build Me Up Buttercup"</a> , and

            <h1>Reception and recordings</h1>
            <p>The concert was met with positive responses from critics, who praised Velasquez's showmanship and vocal
                abilities. Ricky Lo of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philippine_Star">The Philippine
                    Star</a> described the show as a "fully loaded electrifying concert"
                and complimented Velasquez's "boundless energy and creativity". He appreciated how much work went into
                preparing for the show.[14] Ramil Gulle, also from The Philippine Star, acknowledged that Velasquez's
                concert lived up to expectations, writing: "She put up a show that quite no other Filipino pop artist
                has."[13] He commended her maturity and favored her ability to sing with "proper nuances" and "more
                heart", asserting that the show was a reminder of Velasquez's theatrics and vocal talents.[13] Writing
                for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Standard">Manila Standard,</a> Isah Red considered
                its production and vocal performances a benchmark against
                which other Philippine concerts can be measured.[21]

                Critics agreed that the highlight of the night was Velasquez's aerial performance. Lo termed it a
                "decidedly daring or risky action",[14] while in a 2017 retrospective, Elvin Luciano from <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_Philippines">CNN
                    Philippines</a> argued that it was one of Velasquez's most memorable moments.[20] Her fashion during
                the
                show also received praise. Red described Velasquez's costumes as "grand and lavish", adding that "the
                colors and the cuts made our eyes look and appreciate the designs".[21] Alex Vergara of the Philippine
                Daily Inquirer commented that the outfits "did dazzle the audience and suit [Velasquez's] unique flair
                onstage".[19] Although critics were appreciative of Velasquez's vocals, some were critical of her
                spiels; Red wrote, "They just didn't work ... the script was confused in capturing [Velasquez's]
                character.[21] Similarly, Vergara said, "We're clueless on who wrote the script ... was there one at
                all?"[19]

                Velasquez received the Best Female Major Concert Act award at the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliw_Awards">13th Aliw Awards</a> for the
